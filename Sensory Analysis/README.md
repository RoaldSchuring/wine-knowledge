# Taxonomies of Sensory Analysis

We can use many of our senses to analyze wines: sight, taste, smell and (mouth)feel. 

We can categorize a sensory description of a wine into three buckets:
1. Visual
2. Aromas & Flavors
3. Structure

In the interest of simplicity, this part of our wine taxonomy also includes 'Wine Profiles', a taxonomy of simple-to-understand terms that cover Visual, Aroma & Flavor and Structure descriptors.

### Aromas & Flavors

Aromas & Flavors are what we smell and register using our olfactory glands. Wine reviewers are known to be very creaive with the terms they use to describe wines - this helps them appeal to the imagination of customers. And this is great! 

What's less great is that this makes it very hard to draw comparisons across wines. We want to provide a hierarchical taxonomy, consisting of three levels, that maps 'raw' descriptors onto more general categories that help us better understand groupings of aromas & flavors - and therefore taste similarities & differences between wines. 

**Example**:

*A wine may smell like Guava (level_3). This is an aroma of type Tropical Fruit (level_2). This, in turn, is a Fruit descriptor (level_1).*

### Structure

Every wine can be evaluated with a score out of 5 (1 = low, 5 = high) across four structure components.
1. Body: the 'heftiness' of a wine's mouthfeel
2. Acid: the perceived acidity of a wine
3. Sweetness: the perceived sweetness of a wine
4. Tannin: the 'drying' sensation perceived in some wines, typically felt on the tongue and gums

### Wine Profiles

Wine Profiles are descriptions such as 'jammy', 'earthy', and 'sweet' that are easier to understand for wine beginners than a detailed mapping of aromas & flavors, structure component assessments and visual characteristics. 

The intention of wine profiles is to summarize relevant sensory information about a wine into a simple, streamlined yet meaningful taxonomy.
