# Wine Knowledge Repository

This is an open-source repository dedicated to quantifying and sharing the world's wine knowledge. 

## Philosophy

For most people, the world of wine is daunting and shrouded in mystery. How many times have you sat in a restaurant with a wine menu in your hands, only to have absolutely no idea what to choose? How many times have you stood, eyes glazed over, in front of the wine aisle in the supermarket?

We believe that education is the key to empowering people to choose better wine. 

Education begins with common standards around how we talk about wine - a lingua franca for the wine world. This repository contains taxonomies and guidelines for how we can talk about things like wine categorization, sensory analysis, terroir, winemaking techniques and viticulture techniques.

This is a work in progress and we are always looking to evolve the taxonomies presented here. Please submit a PR for any ideas for improvement you may have, or contact roald@vinebase.com.
