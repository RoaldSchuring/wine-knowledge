# Taxonomies of Tasting Wine

At a high level, there are two dimensions to tasting wine: (i) Aromas & Flavors, and (ii) Structure.

### Aromas & Flavors

Aromas & Flavors are what we smell and register using our olfactory glands. Wine reviewers are known to be very creaive with the terms they use to describe wines - this helps them appeal to the imagination of customers. And this is great! 

What's less great is that this makes it very hard to draw comparisons across wines. We want to provide a hierarchical taxonomy, consisting of three levels, that maps 'raw' descriptors onto more general categories that help us better understand groupings of aromas & flavors - and therefore taste similarities & differences between wines. 

#### Example:

##### A wine may smell like Guava (level_3). This is an aroma of type Tropical Fruit (level_2). This, in turn, is a Fruit descriptor (level_1). 


### Structure

Every wine can be evaluated with a score out of 5 (1 = low, 5 = high) across four structure components.
1. Body: the 'heftiness' of a wine's mouthfeel
2. Acid: the perceived acidity of a wine
3. Sweetness: the perceived sweetness of a wine
4. Tannin: the 'drying' sensation perceived in some wines, typically felt on the tongue and gums
